# MainComponent

Everything that belongs to the central componente that will be used both by web application as to be used by Electronjs. Preferably, without any change.

Right now, I don't know how is the best ever possible way to prepare the componente to fit seamlessly by web application or Electronjs. The whole Vue environment development are in the folder `vuejs2`, so nothing that is out from pure Vue are inside this folder. If something in adittional will be required that does not make sense to Vue will stay here.
